* k-mean algorithm:
  * k_mean function : 
    input: given data_set (m x p), m: number of data, p : p-dimension space and k-cluster.
    output: centroids (k x p).
    
    * first randomly select and the initial cluster points.
    * keep iteration until the stop_iteration true.
    * assign_labels: given current_centrodis, use them to assign which cluster every data belongs to.
    * getCentroids: With current label_array and data_set, calculate the centroids coordinates.
